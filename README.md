# learning-pcl
Learning some PCL. I intend to apply the obtained knowledge at some 3D Computer Vision problems.

Some overview of each folder

## 001_hello_world

I learned how to set up PCL on Ubuntu. I also learned how to use Cmake and coded a simple PCL visualizer.c

## 002_centering_cloud

I learned how to center a point cloud.

## 003_transforming_cloud

I reformulated the `002_centering_cloud` in order to perform the transformations in a more generic approach.
